HW03
===
This is the hw03 sample. Please follow the steps below.

# Build the Sample Program

1. Fork this repo to your own github account.

2. Clone the repo that you just forked.

3. Under the hw03 dir, use:

	* `make` to build.

	* `make clean` to clean the ouput files.

4. Extract `gnu-mcu-eclipse-qemu.zip` into hw03 dir. Under the path of hw03, start emulation with `make qemu`.

	See [Lecture 02 ─ Emulation with QEMU] for more details.

5. The sample is a minimal program for ARM Cortex-M4 devices, which enters `while(1);` after reset. Use gdb to get more details.

	See [ESEmbedded_HW02_Example] for knowing how to do the observation and how to use markdown for taking notes.

# Build Your Own Program

1. Edit main.c.

2. Make and run like the steps above.

3. Please avoid using hardware dependent C Standard library functions like `printf`, `malloc`, etc.

# HW03 Requirements

1. How do C functions pass and return parameters? Please describe the related standard used by the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the ARM architecture.

2. Modify main.c to observe what you found.

3. You have to state how you designed the observation (code), and how you performed it.

	Just like how you did in HW02.

3. If there are any official data that define the rules, you can also use them as references.

4. Push your repo to your github. (Use .gitignore to exclude the output files like object files or executable files and the qemu bin folder)

我觀察到的結果是 我們輸入的參數會先從r0 r1 r2開始存入 如果輸入的參數超過五個 第五個參數會存到stak裡
，參數回傳則是從r0回傳，若為64位元由r0 r1回傳。
r4 到r11則存區域變數，在進入函式時，函式如果要用到r4到r10這些暫存器 必須先儲存暫存器裡的值，跳出函數前復原。
